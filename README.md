# **Course Project: Full-cycle Job Application Tracker**

> This repository contains a full-stack **Job Application Tracker** developed for coursework at the **University of Information Technology (UIT - VNU-HCM)**.
>
> The system supports the full recruitment flow: candidates can search jobs and apply with CVs, recruiters can manage job posts, screen applications, schedule interviews, send messages and onboarding tasks, while admins can moderate users and job listings. The project is built with **React 18 + Vite**, **Express.js**, **PostgreSQL**, **JWT authentication**, and a Docker-based development/deployment setup.

## **Database Overview**

The PostgreSQL schema covers recruitment, onboarding, messaging, and HR workflows.

```text
users
|-- candidates
|-- recruiters
`-- admins through role-based access

recruiters
`-- job_posts
    `-- applications
        |-- application_files
        |-- application_events
        |-- application_notes
        |-- interviews
        |-- messages
        `-- onboarding_tasks

candidates
|-- saved_jobs
|-- employees
|   |-- attendance_records
|   `-- leave_requests
`-- password_reset_tokens
```

Important tables include:

- `users`, `candidates`, `recruiters`
- `job_posts`, `applications`, `application_files`
- `application_events`, `application_notes`
- `interviews`, `messages`
- `onboarding_tasks`, `employees`
- `attendance_records`, `leave_requests`
- `password_reset_tokens`, `saved_jobs`

---

## **Installation**

### **1. Clone repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd HR-Management
```

### **2. Install dependencies**

The project is managed from the repository root.

```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Prepare environment files**

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item backend/.env.example backend/.env
Copy-Item frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

### **4. Start PostgreSQL with Docker**

```bash
npm run db:up
```

### **5. Run the app in development**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend health check: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`

---

## **Environment Variables**

### **Backend**

Create `backend/.env` from `backend/.env.example`.

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres123@localhost:5433/job_tracker
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-key-change-this-in-production
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-specific-password
SMTP_FROM=Job Tracker <noreply@jobtracker.com>
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads/cv
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=20
```

### **Frontend**

Create `frontend/.env` from `frontend/.env.example`.

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

---

## **Usage**

### **Development commands**

```bash
npm run dev          # Run backend and frontend together
npm run dev:backend  # Run Express API only
npm run dev:frontend # Run Vite frontend only
npm run build:frontend
```

### **Database commands**

```bash
npm run db:up
npm run db:down
npm run db:reset
npm run db:logs
```

---

## **Docker Deployment**

The full stack can run with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Services:

| Service | Port | Description |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| `db` | `5433:5432` | PostgreSQL 16 |
| `backend` | `5000:5000` | Express.js API |
| `frontend` | `5173:80` | nginx serving Vite build |

The frontend nginx container proxies API calls from `/api` to `backend:5000`.

---

## **API Overview**

Main route groups:

| Route | Purpose |
|:--|:--|
| `/api/auth` | Signup, login, logout, refresh token, password reset |
| `/api/users` | Current user profile, avatar/logo upload, notification preferences |
| `/api/job-posts` | Job listing, advanced search, recruiter job CRUD |
| `/api/applications` | Candidate applications and recruiter application pipeline |
| `/api/interviews` | Interview scheduling and listing |
| `/api/messages` | Candidate-recruiter messaging |
| `/api/onboarding` | Onboarding tasks |
| `/api/employees` | Employee conversion, attendance, leave requests |
| `/api/admin` | Admin dashboard, user management, job moderation |
| `/api/notifications` | SSE notification stream |

---

## **Security Highlights**

- Passwords are hashed with `bcryptjs`.
- Access tokens are short-lived and stored in memory on the frontend.
- Refresh tokens are stored in httpOnly cookies.
- Protected routes use `requireAuth` and role-based guards.
- Request payloads are validated with `zod`.
- SQL queries use parameterized `pg` queries.
- `helmet`, CORS configuration, and rate limiting are enabled on the backend.
- CVs and profile images are stored on the filesystem, not as binary blobs in PostgreSQL.

---

## **Demo Flow**

### **Candidate Flow**

1. Sign up or log in as candidate.
2. Search jobs using filters.
3. Save a job or apply with CV upload.
4. Track application status.
5. Check messages, onboarding tasks, and employee portal after acceptance.

### **Recruiter Flow**

1. Log in as recruiter.
2. Create a job post.
3. Review applications in the recruiter application page.
4. Download CV, add notes, rate candidate, and run AI screening.
5. Schedule interview, reject candidate, or send offer.
6. Convert accepted candidate to employee and manage HR records.

### **Admin Flow**

1. Log in as admin.
2. Review dashboard stats.
3. Lock or unlock users.
4. Hide, unhide, or delete job posts.

---

## **Roadmap**

- Add complete unit and integration test coverage.
- Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.
- Add Kanban board for recruiter application pipeline.
- Add production object storage support for uploaded CVs and profile images.
- Add seed data and a guided 15-minute demo script.
